There is a seeming abundance of posts and tutorials on integrating Facebook with Omniauth and Devise, but nothing definitive on making it all asynchronous (zero reloads or redirections).  The closest implementations are found in an example Sinatra app that the creators of the omniauth-facebook gem have made and a blog post that gets everything right except for the asynchronous part.  My goal in writing this post is two part. I want to walk you through the creation of an an asynchronous Facebook login in a rails application using Devise, Omniauth, and Facebook's javascript SDK so you can achieve something like this (github link coming soon). I also want you to gain a conceptual understanding of how all the different pieces fit together.

I'm going to assume that you already have a rails app created, and that you have a basic understanding of how the MVC interface and routing system works in rails.  To begin, we're going to add the following gems to our gem file: 

```ruby
#gemfile
gem 'devise'
gem 'omniauth'
gem 'omniauth-facebook', '1.4.0'
gem 'oauth2'
```

Let's handle initialization next. Run the following in terminal or command prompt: `rails g devise:install`

This will generate an initialization file called `devise.rb` in `/config/initializers/`. We need to add one more initializer, called `omniauth.rb`. It should contain the following:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :facebook, '[public_key]', '[private_key]'
end 
```

Next, we're going to generate the requisite models, controllers, and views and populate them with content. Let's create the controller and view that the user directly interacts with first. In the terminal or command prompt, type the following:

```bash
rails g controller home index
```

Make sure to add `root to: "home#index"` to your routes file. In the index view, add the following:

```html
<div id="fb-root"></div> <!-- Needed for facebook to function properly. See facebook sdk for more info. -->

<div id="results"></div>

<p id="connect">
  <a class="signin" href="#">Signin</a>
  <a class="signout" href="#">Signout</a>
</p>

<script type="text/javascript">

  window.fbAsyncInit = function() {
    FB.init({
      appId  : '[#insert_app_id_here]',
      status : true, // check login status
      cookie : true, // enable cookies to allow the server to access the session
      xfbml  : true  // parse XFBML
    });
  };

  (function(d) {
    var js, id = 'facebook-jssdk'; if (d.getElementById(id)) {return;}
    js = d.createElement('script'); js.id = id; js.async = true;
    js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js";
    d.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(js);
  }(document));

  $(function() {
    $('#connect .signin').click(function(e) {
      e.preventDefault();

      FB.login(function(response) {
        if (response.authResponse) {
          $('#results').html('Connected! Hitting OmniAuth callback (GET users/auth/facebook/callback)...');

          // since we have cookies enabled, this request will allow omniauth to parse
          // out the auth code from the signed request in the fbsr_XXX cookie
          $.getJSON('users/auth/facebook/callback', function(json) {
            $('#results').html(JSON.stringify(json));
            // Do some other stuff here (call more json, load in more elements, etc)
          });
        }
      }, { scope: 'email,read_stream' }); // These are the permissions you are requesting
    });

    $('#connect .signout').click(function(e) {
      e.preventDefault();
      $.getJSON('/auth/facebook/signout', function(json) {
        $('#results').html(JSON.stringify(json));
      });
    });

  });

</script>
```

You can read a more detailed overview in Facebook's documentation, but essentially we are loading in the javascript SDK, configuring an initialization function, and attaching event handlers on our sign-in and sign-out links that make additional requests/calls. If the sign-in link is clicked, we call a login method on the FB object, and pass in a function that will be run upon callback. This function is passed a response object that contains an authorization token, an expiration date for the token, and a few other details, but these are irrelevant. We only want to check that the response has returned successfully, and then make a GET request to our server. More about this later. Let's head back to the routes file.

In your routes file, add the following: 

```ruby
devise_for :users, :only => :omniauth_callbacks 
match 'users/auth/:provider/callback' => 'authentications#create' 
match '/auth/:provider/signout' => 'authentications#signout' 
```

We haven't created the user or authentication models yet, but this is the most crucial step, and one that was the most difficult in getting correct. When the the JSON request is made in our login callback function, we are sending a GET request to users/auth/facebook/callback. We need to route this call to a controller to handle authentication logic, but we need to do it in such a way so that omniauth can hook in first, extract the relevant data, and pass it on to the controller. Our omniauth-facebook gem provides a strategy to omniauth for parsing out this data. We also need to set up routes for devise to handle the omniauth callbacks and "map" the user model we have yet to create. More on this integration can be found in the oauth2, omniauth, and devise gems, but be warned: these services are meant to be black boxed and obscured from the developer in hope of simplicity, and things get complicated fast. I still am not entirely sure how devise and omniauth communicate with one another during this process. Both of the first two routes have to be present in order for authentication to work, and the auth/:provider/callback must be prefixed with model that devise is mapping.

The index action of the authentications controller will be handling this callback as specified in the routes, so let's go ahead and create it. Type the following in your terminal or command prompt: 

```bash
rails g model Authentication user_id:integer provider:string uid:string token:string
rails g controller authentication 
```
In your authentication model, add the following:

```ruby
class Authentication < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :provider, :token, :uid, :user_id
  belongs_to :user
end
```

Add this to your controller:

```ruby
class AuthenticationsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    auth = request.env['omniauth.auth']
    logger.debug "Auth variable: #{auth.inspect}"

    # Try to find authentication first
    authentication = Authentication.find_by_provider_and_uid(auth['provider'], auth['uid'])
    
    unless current_user 
      # Request a new 60 day token using the current 2 hour token obtained from fb
      auth.merge!(extend_fb_token(auth['credentials']['token']))
      authentication.update_attribute("token", auth['extension']['token']) if authentication

      unless authentication
        user = User.new
        user.apply_omniauth(auth)
        saved_status = user.save(:validate => false)
      end

      # Add the new token and expiration date to the user's session
      create_or_refresh_fb_session(auth)
      if saved_status.nil? || saved_status
        user = authentication ? authentication.user : user
        sign_in(:user, user)
      end
    end

    render :json => { :success => (current_user ? true : false), 
                      :current_user => current_user.as_json(:only => [:email]) }
  end

  def signout
    success = delete_fb_session && sign_out(:user)
    render :json => { :success => success.as_json }
  end

  def create_or_refresh_fb_session(auth_hash_or_extension_hash)
    if auth_hash_or_extension_hash['extension']
      session.merge!({
          "fb_access_token" => auth_hash_or_extension_hash['extension']['token'],
          "fb_expiry" => auth_hash_or_extension_hash['extension']['expiry'].to_i + Time.now.to_i
      })
    elsif auth_hash_or_extension_hash['credentials']
      session.merge!({
          "fb_access_token" => auth_hash_or_extension_hash['credentials']['token'],
          "fb_expiry" => auth_hash_or_extension_hash['credentials']['expires_at']
      })
    end
  end

  def extend_fb_token(token)
    # can be called once a day to extend fb access token
    # if called twice or more in one day, will return the same token

    require "net/https"
    require "uri"

    uri = URI.parse("https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token?client_id=[#app_id]&client_secret=[#secret_key]&grant_type=fb_exchange_token&fb_exchange_token="+token)
    http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)
    http.use_ssl = true
    http.verify_mode = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE

    request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri.request_uri)

    response = http.request(request)
    matched_response = /access_token=(.+)&expires=(.+)/.match(response.body)
    parsed_response = Hash["extension", Hash["token", matched_response[1], "expiry", matched_response[2]]]
    return parsed_response
  end

  def delete_fb_session
    session.delete("fb_expiry")
    session.delete("fb_access_token")
  end

end
```

A lot is going on in this code, so let's break it down. If you recall from earlier, omniauth-facebook is hooking in first when we make the callback and then passing on some information to the create action in our authentications controller (as specified in the routes). This information comes in the form of a hash contained within request.env['omniauth.auth']. You can see what an example auth hash looks like in the omniauth-facebook documentation. (For those that are curious: Remember how I mentioned that the information you get back from that initial call to Facebook is irrelevant? Well, it still is. Facebook set a cookie containing our app ID and an encrypted message when the first callback was completed in our FB.login method. This cookie is automatically read by omniauth-facebook, decrypted, and an additional request is made to the Facebook servers to generate the hash that we see in the create action.)  If no user is currently signed in, we grab the token that is passed through in the hash and try to extend its lifetime. By default, if you are using Facebook's JS SDK to authorize a user, the token that you obtain will last only for two hours. Facebook provides a mechanism to pass this token back and obtain a new one that lasts for 60 days, so we do so. We then store this new token in the database and session, and attempt to log in the user. If no authentication was found earlier, then we create a new user entry and associate it with a new authentication during this process. 

Let's move on to the user model. We need to include the devise functionality and add an apply_omniauth method to build an authentication for new users. 
```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  # Include default devise modules. Others available are:
  # :token_authenticatable, :confirmable,
  # :lockable, :timeoutable and :omniauthable
  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
         :recoverable, :rememberable, :trackable, :validatable,
         :omniauthable

  # Setup accessible (or protected) attributes for your model
  attr_accessible :email, :password, :password_confirmation, :remember_me
  has_many :playlists
  has_many :authentications

  def apply_omniauth(auth)
    self.email = auth['extra']['raw_info']['email']
    authentications.build(:provider => auth['provider'], :uid => auth['uid'], :token => auth['extension']['token'])
  end
end
```

That's it! This is all very bare bones, and you'll definitely want to handle the display of sign-in and sign-out links and what happens when a callback is successful (i.e. read the json response, confirm that success: true, and make some additional calls). The good news is that this method is easily extendable to twitter and github asynchronous logins  - you only need to install the proper gem, make another entry in the omniauth initialization file, and add some more logic to the create action in the authentications controller.
